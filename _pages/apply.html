<p>
  We always welcome self-motivated and hard-working students <a href="{{ '/' | relative_url }}">who share our research interests and are passionate about our mission</a>.
  If you are looking for a Ph.D. position, please read about our admission requirements for <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/phd/admissions" target=_blank>CS</a>, <a href="https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece/programs/graduate-programs/phd-program/phd-admission-process" target=_blank>ECE</a>, and <a href="https://www.mae.cornell.edu/mae/programs/graduate-programs/phd-degree/admissions" target=_blank>MAE</a> as we may be looking for students across all these departments.
  Unfortunately, we are not going to be able to reply to generic admissions related questions via email.
  If you are interested in working with Tapo, we would suggest applying to the above departments based on your preference and mentioning his name in your application packet.
</p>

<p>
  If you have any specific questions about our work, please email <a href="{{ '/people/' | relative_url }}">Tapo</a> with <strong>EmPRISE21</strong> in your email subject and your CV.
  Though he tries to respond to all the emails, the sheer volume of emails sometimes gets the better of him.
  So, this code is just so that he can focus on emails from people who have taken some time to read about our lab.
</p>

<p>
  If you are a Master's or an Undergraduate student researcher at Cornell who is interested in working with us, please use the same code above in your email subject and send an email to <code>empriselab21 at gmail.com</code> with your CV and transcripts.
  We do not fund master's or undergraduate student researchers when they just start out with the lab.
  We do offer research credits.
  Typically, you would end up working with a Ph.D. student mentor, if available.
  You are expected to commit to at least 10 hours per week and a minimum of 2 semesters in the lab.
</p>

<p>
  Currently, we are not actively looking for any external internship students and postdoctoral candidates. But we are always opportunistic.
  So please do not hesitate to write to us in case you feel like there is a great fit.
