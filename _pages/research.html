<h2>Human-Robot Commensality</h2>

<p>
  Being able to eat independently with friends and family is considered one of 
  the most memorable and important activities for people with mobility 
  limitations. Robots can potentially help with this activity but robot-assisted 
  feeding is a multi-faceted problem with challenges in bite acquisition, bite 
  timing, and bite transfer. Bite timing in particular becomes uniquely 
  challenging in social dining scenarios due to the possibility of interrupting 
  a social human-robot group interaction during commensality. Our key insight is 
  that bite timing strategies that take into account the delicate balance of 
  social cues can lead to seamless interactions during robot-assisted feeding in 
  a social dining scenario. We approach this problem by collecting a multimodal 
  Human-Human Commensality Dataset (HHCD) containing 30 groups of three people 
  eating together. We use this dataset to analyze human-human commensality 
  behaviors and develop bite timing prediction models in social dining scenarios. 
  We also transfer these models to human-robot commensality scenarios. Our user 
  studies show that prediction improves when our algorithm uses multimodal social 
  signaling cues between diners to model bite timing.

<h2>Robot-assisted Feeding</h2>

<p>
  Eating is an activity of daily living (ADL) and losing the ability to
  self-feed can be devastating. Robots have the potential to help with these
  tasks. Successful robotic assistive feeding depends on reliable bite
  acquisition, appropriate bite timing, and easy bite transfer in both
  individual and social dining settings. Automating bite acquisition is daunting
  as the universe of foods, cutlery, and human strategies is massive and the
  activity demands robust nonprehensile manipulation of a deformable
  hard-to-model target. Bite timing, especially in social dining settings, is a
  delicate dance of multimodal signaling (via gaze, facial expressions,
  gestures, and speech, to name a few), action, and sometimes coercion. Bite
  transfer constitutes a unique type of robot-human handover where the human
  needs to use the mouth. Through this project, we are developing algorithms and
  technologies that can address these challenges towards a robotic system that
  can autonomously feed people with upper-extremity mobility limitations in real
  homes.

<h2>Compliant Manipulation with Whole-arm Sensing</h2>

<p>
  Physical interactions between robots and humans are inevitable and desired
  during caregiving. Tactile sensing can enable a robot to infer properties of
  its surroundings from planned and incidental contact during manipulation in
  unstructured human environments. Through this project, we are developing
  solutions that can efficiently combine multimodal sensing and perception to
  develop intelligent planning and control policies for safe and efficient
  manipulation with and around humans.
